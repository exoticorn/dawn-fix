# Dawn by Icebird (fixed)

20 years ago, I coded a demo for the gameboy with graphics done by a gizmo.
Back then, I was only really able to test my code on a single emulator, not
on the real hardware. Turns out, that emulator got its hblank interupts
slightly wrong and was off by one scanline, which garbled the first screen
which was supposed to be a spinning 'icebird' text.

Now, after 20 years, there is a patched version of this demo that fixes this
first screen.

Dawn.gb is the original rom, Dawn_fixed.gb (unsuprisingly) the fixed version.
